Michelle can work with you to create and design a beautiful interior space. From a single room, house, residence or commercial project.

Once Michelle has established the brief and budget with the client she will develop a raft of ideas from which the final direction can be agreed.  She will then work with architects, contractors, suppliers and the client to achieve the best possible results.  

For each project Michelle sources colour schemes, wallpapers, furniture, furnishings, floorings, tiles, antiques, art, lighting and unique objects to create a beautiful and inspiring environment.

Michelle has worked in the creative industries for twenty years.  Working as a fashion stylist she has been the creative force behind some of the most distinctive and beautiful images in contemporary pop and fashion. Michelle brings her sense of sophisticated style and fashion to her interior projects. Mixing high end glamour with a romantic and individual touch.
