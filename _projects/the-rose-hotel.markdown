The restoration of a run down hotel / pub in the seaside town of Deal. Fusing eclectic design with luxurious style. This was a collaboration with Harding and Reed to transform and create a chic eight bedroom hotel.

The rooms at The Rose are typical of Michelleâ€™s style each with a different well choreographed romp of colour.
